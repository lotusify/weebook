/* ========== MAIN CSS - IMPORTS ALL MODULES ========== */

/* Base Styles */
@import url('base/variables.css');
@import url('base/reset.css');

/* Layout */
@import url('layout/header.css');

/* Components */
@import url('components/search.css');
@import url('components/cards.css');

/* Rest of the original styles */
/* NOTE: This is a temporary solution. The remaining 8000+ lines from style.css
   are still loaded from the old file until we complete the full modularization.
   For now, we'll keep style.css as a fallback and gradually migrate sections. */
